Final Fantasy IX :: Unpacked
============================

This project aims to create extracting tools for Final Fantasy IX.

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/arcanis/trivia.ff9/wiki/_pages) !

Dependencies
------------

We're using Boost and Make.

You will have to use your own FF9.IMG file, we won't provide any.

Current state
-------------

We're able to extract FF9.IMG's directories.

Help
----

We're needing more people ! If you know anything about the game structure, please share it so we can build better tools together !

If you find an issue in one of the utilities, or want to discuss about a wiki article, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/arcanis/trivia.ff9/issues).
